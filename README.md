# 🤖 Welcome to the Sumobots Coding Section!

# About the Guide
This guide provides a basic scaffold of code to control a sumobot. We have created 3 separate files for participants of different skill levels. This Guide was collaboratively created by Ryan Kwok, Albert Huu, Akhil Govan, and Bhavi Chauhan of the Mechatronics Projects and Workshops Team at UNSW. We are dedicated to providing resources and support for your sumobot coding journey. If you have any questions or see any errors please reach out to us on the discord. 

## Code files 📁: 
- standardEasierStarterCode.ino - The basic sumobot scaffold with examples of functions, system states, etc... - for those who are less familiar with coding
- standardStarterCode.ino - A basic scaffold of sumobot code - for experienced coders looking to challenge themselves
- advancedStarterCode.ino - Starting scaffold for the advanced stream, standard stream may find this code too complex

# 1. Getting Started
Open up your Arduino IDE and configure the right setting for your port and Arduino Nano. If you don't know how to do this, please watch our Arduino basics and motor control workshop videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qaol1ywlcjQ&ab_channel=UNSWMechatronicsSociety).

# 2. Setting up the Arduino IDE
Covered in Workshop 4 and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qaol1ywlcjQ&ab_channel=UNSWMechatronicsSociety), download and set up the Arduino IDE
1. Download the Arduino IDE [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) or at https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
2. Create a new sketch
3. Copy & paste the code in MotorControlDemo.ino to test whether you have connected your sumobot correctly
4. To upload code to your sumobot, connect it to your computer, and select the correct port and board type in the top left (Port should look something like "usbserial", "COM5" or similar. A trick you can use to identify the port is by disconnecting and reconnecting the port and seeing which port disappears from the list).
   
## Upload Errors:
If you have no errors, you are in luck!

It's always a mission uploading code using the IDE, here's a fix to a common error that occurs:

Run the old bootlegger. Go to Tools > Processor > Atmega328P(Old bootlegger):

Now try uploading again, it should work!

If the same or similar error persists, ensure the right board and port is selected, press the reset button on the Arduino or restart your IDE.

# 3. Testing Your Motors 🏍️ 
MotorControlDemo.ino is a small program that will allow you to test whether you have soldered your motor pins correctly, and test out motor movement. You may also like to take some inspiration from the functions in your own sumobot code!

# Programming tips
## For those unfamiliar with code:
If you haven't completed COMP1511 yet, and you want to try to code your sumobot, we have prepared some slides on the basics of coding (quiz included), available [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGI8cjTvJ0/wV9paa2z3HaPYgHhJyGpxg/edit)

There are also mentors who are happy to help you out, and if we're not available, surely your teammates would lend a helping hand, right?

## General Sumobot Coding Advice:
- One approach discussed briefly at the end of workshop 4 and/or in week 5's build session was to use system states, implemented using a switch/case statement, as well as a variable to keep track of which state your sumobot is currently in.
- Coding system states are also covered in the [slides](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGI8cjTvJ0/wV9paa2z3HaPYgHhJyGpxg/edit)
- Try not to make functions too long, as it can make code hard to read. If you find that a certain piece of code is too long, see if you can direct the functionality to another function.
- Don't overthink it; Often the simplest code is the best solution
- Stick with a consistent coding style - Makes code easier to read
